## Hellooo! <img src="https://media3.giphy.com/media/NQDcH2ZZaPV8QBDYK3/giphy.gif" width="20px">
Hi, I'm Alfian. I am a developer, especially in the back-end and also in mobile applications. My experience in IT is about 5 years, and I am also a bug hunter. Currently I'm managing and developing [Prantara](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rekberapppilatek)ðŸ˜‰.

P.S: maybe you don't find much on my profile because I don't have any idea to make a public project yet :(
